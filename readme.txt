Description
-----------
AddressBookDemo assesses four static, strongly typed languages and widget
libraries as candidates for creating desktop applications targeting the Gnome
desktop environment. The languages and widget libraries are:

 * Java / Swing
 * Scala / SWT
 * C# / GTK#
 * Vala / GTK

The program is of little functional value - it merely allows the user to create
a list of "contacts" containing name, email and phone details.

It's main purpose is to demonstrate the use of common UI elements including
windows, dialogs, tables, input validation, keyboard shortcuts and event
handling.

Building
--------
Each of the implementations contains specific building instructions.
